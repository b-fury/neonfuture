Hey, I'm B. Iâ€™m a Mechanical Engineer specializing in Research & Development. I hold a BS in Mechanical Engineering and an MBA, both from Northeastern University. 
I used to run a long-dead site called t3chniq.com where we covered gadgets for several years. 

I miss those days, so I am back at it here :)
